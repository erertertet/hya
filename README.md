hya is an event-sourced, multi-agent coding agent. `hya-backend` owns the
runtime: it normalizes OpenAI Chat/Responses/Codex, Grok Build, Anthropic, and
Google provider routes into one canonical event stream and executes tools behind
a permission plane. Every client-facing surface speaks one consolidated contract
— `hya.v1` — served identically over HTTP/JSON+SSE+WebSocket (`/v1`) and gRPC
(`HYA_GRPC_BIND`); the legacy Compat and native HTTP routes are gone. There is
an OpenTUI frontend lives in `packages/hya-tui` and connects to the server
through HTTP/JSON+SSE. Other clients use `hya-sdk-v1`, `hya-client`, or any
`hya.v1` client.


If no provider is configured, hya still runs: it falls back to an offline
"dev" provider that echoes prompts, so the whole stack is usable without API
keys while you set things up.

## Status

hya is under active development (workspace version `0.37.5`,
`MIT OR Apache-2.0`). Build this checkout from source as described below.
APIs, config, and command surfaces may still change between versions.


## Build From Source

Requires a Rust toolchain matching the workspace manifest
([`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml); currently edition 2024, Rust `1.91`), Git, and Bun
(pinned at 1.3.14 for the Compat adapter runtime).

```sh
git clone <this-repo> hya
cd hya
./install.sh --prefix "$HOME/.local"
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
hya-backend serve
```

The installer places the `hya-backend` binary plus `lib/hya/compat-adapter/`
with its production dependencies.

To use the OpenTUI frontend with the running server:

```sh
cd packages/hya-tui
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun src/main.ts --server http://127.0.0.1:8080 --dir "$PWD/../.."
```

See [OpenTUI frontend](docs/tui.md) for commands, keys, and the API command view.


## Configure a Provider and Log In

By default `hya-backend` starts offline. To use a live model, create
`~/.config/hya/config.yaml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hya/config.yaml`):

```yaml
default_model: claude-sonnet-4-6
providers:
  anthropic:
    kind: anthropic
    base_url: https://api.anthropic.com/v1
    api_key: "{env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
    models: [claude-sonnet-4-6]
```

You can supply the key inline (via `{env:VAR}`, `{file:/path}`, or a literal)
or store it with `hya-backend login`, which takes precedence over an inline `api_key`:

```sh
hya-backend login anthropic "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
hya-backend models  # inspect the resolved catalog
hya-backend serve   # start the HTTP/SSE server against the live provider
```

For ChatGPT Codex or Grok Build subscription OAuth (no API key):

```sh
hya-backend oauth login --provider codex --type openai-codex
hya-backend oauth login --provider grok --type grok-build
hya-backend oauth status
```

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for first-run behavior,
the `HYA_*` (and related) environment-variable tables, and a fully-commented
sample config.

## What hya Can Do

- Headless single-turn execution (`hya-backend exec` / `hya-backend run`) and iterative goal
  mode (`hya-backend -p "<goal>"`).
- HTTP/SSE/WebSocket server (`hya-backend serve`) exposing the consolidated
  `hya.v1` contract under `/v1`, plus optional gRPC via `HYA_GRPC_BIND`; see the
  [protocol guide](docs/protocol/README.md) and generated
  [API reference](docs/protocol/api-reference.md). Typed clients:
  `hya-sdk-v1` and `hya-client` (crates), or any generated `hya.v1` stub.
- MCP servers, plugins (including a Compat plugin adapter), and a formatter
  plane, all driven from the same config.

Public AgentBundles may remain static/process-free or supply selected
Bundle-local Bun sidecar capabilities. Public WorkflowBundles package one
compiled Workflow with its exact reachable Agent closure. Both kinds can be
inspected and installed with `hya-backend bundle info -f example.hyabundle` and
`hya-backend bundle install example.hyabundle`. See the
[AgentBundle authoring guide](docs/agent-bundle-authoring.md),
[Workflow and WorkflowBundle guide](docs/workflows.md),
[static example](docs/examples/bundle.hya.md),
[transient Bun example](docs/examples/bun-transient/),
[resident Bun example](docs/examples/bun-resident/),
[disjoint Bun example](docs/examples/bun-disjoint/), and the full
[Argus WorkflowBundle example](bundles/examples/argus-example/) plus the
[CLI reference](docs/cli.md#bundle-commands).
