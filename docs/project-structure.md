# Project Structure

hya is organized as a Rust workspace of small crates. The central idea is that
every runtime surface shares one canonical event model:

```text
CLI / OpenTUI / HTTP
      |
      v
hya-backend / hya-server
      |
      +--> hya-app::WorkflowControl
      |      +--> hya-workflow compiles/normalizes Workflow plans
      |      `--> hya-core::SessionEngine executes durable Workflow runs
      |
      `--> hya-core::SessionEngine (ordinary turns)
             |
             +--> hya-provider routes model streams into hya-proto::Event
             +--> hya-tool executes builtin, MCP, and plugin tools behind PermissionPlane
             +--> hya-store appends and replays events
             +--> hya-proto folds events into projections
```

## `hya-proto`

`hya-proto` is deliberately dependency-light so other crates can share wire
types without pulling in async runtimes, SQL, or HTTP.

Important modules:

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`api.rs`](../crates/hya-proto/src/api.rs) | HTTP request/response DTOs for create session, prompt, events query. |
| [`event.rs`](../crates/hya-proto/src/event.rs) | Canonical `Event` enum and ordered `Envelope`. |
| [`ids.rs`](../crates/hya-proto/src/ids.rs) | Strongly typed ids: new sessions use `hysec_...`; messages, parts, and tool calls keep UUID-backed display prefixes such as `msg_` and `tc_`. |
| [`message.rs`](../crates/hya-proto/src/message.rs) | `Message`, `Part`, role, finish reason, token and cost structs. |
| [`model.rs`](../crates/hya-proto/src/model.rs) | String newtypes for agents, models, tools, and model-facing tool schemas. |
| [`projection.rs`](../crates/hya-proto/src/projection.rs) | Idempotent reducer from envelopes to `Projection`, plus the roster-aware address/channel resolution the store gate and engine reader share. |
| [`scope.rs`](../crates/hya-proto/src/scope.rs) | Canonical agent paths, the parent/sibling/report scope rule, and unit-qualified channel keys ([ADR-0011](adr/0011-hierarchy-scoped-mailbox.md)). |

The reducer ignores duplicate or older envelopes by comparing `Envelope.seq` to
`Projection.last_seq`, which makes replay and SSE reconnect logic use the same
state transition rules.

## `hya-provider`

`hya-provider` normalizes upstream model protocols into `hya_proto::Event`.

Important modules:

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`lib.rs`](../crates/hya-provider/src/lib.rs) | Provider, protocol, decoder traits, capabilities, request type, preflight. |
| [`router.rs`](../crates/hya-provider/src/router.rs) | Selects a provider by model id and runs capability preflight. |
| [`http.rs`](../crates/hya-provider/src/http.rs) | Shared HTTP/SSE driver with redirect-disabled reqwest client. |
| [`openai.rs`](../crates/hya-provider/src/openai.rs) | OpenAI Chat Completions compatible encoder/decoder. |
| [`anthropic.rs`](../crates/hya-provider/src/anthropic.rs) | Anthropic Messages encoder/decoder. |
| [`google.rs`](../crates/hya-provider/src/google.rs) | Gemini encoder/decoder, including canonical media part support. |
| [`dev.rs`](../crates/hya-provider/src/dev.rs) | Offline provider used when no live config is available. |
| [`fake.rs`](../crates/hya-provider/src/fake.rs) | Scripted provider for tests. |
| [`wire.rs`](../crates/hya-provider/src/wire.rs) | Shared helpers for encoding stored tool parts back to provider wire format. |

Providers do not execute tools. They stream text, reasoning, tool-call requests,
and finish reasons; the engine executes requested tools and appends results.

## `hya-tool`

`hya-tool` defines the model-facing tool surface and the permission plane.

Important modules:

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`permission.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/permission.rs) | Action/resource rules, `Allow`/`Ask`/`Deny`, ask requests, persistent allow-always decisions. |
| [`tool.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/tool.rs) | Tool trait, registry, aliases, shared context, path/search helpers. |
| [`read.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/read.rs), [`write.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/write.rs), [`edit.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/edit.rs), [`apply_patch`](../crates/hya-tool/src/apply_patch) | File read/write/edit/patch tools. |
| [`shell.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/shell.rs) | Canonical `bash` execution tool with real PTY support; legacy `shell` remains a hidden dispatch alias. |
| [`webfetch`](../crates/hya-tool/src/webfetch), [`websearch.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/websearch.rs) | Web fetch/search tools. |
| [`lsp.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/lsp.rs), [`formatter.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/formatter.rs) | LSP and formatter planes. |
| [`skill.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/skill.rs), [`task.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/task.rs), [`todo.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/todo.rs), [`ask_user.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/ask_user.rs) | Skill, subtask, todo, and human-question tools. |
| [`workflow_plane.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/workflow_plane.rs) | Workflow list/info/use/run/state tool integration through `WorkflowControl`. |

Builtins currently include **27 canonical schema names** (aliases are listed
separately below):

| Tool | Permission action | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read` | `Read` | Read normalized hashline/raw text, media files, or directory listings with bounded truncation. |
| `write` | `Edit` | Write through the shared atomic/hashline runtime, then run formatter/LSP post-edit hooks. |
| `edit` | `Edit` | Apply strict anchored hashline operations with exact stale recovery and post-commit reconciliation. |
| `apply_patch` (`patch`) | `Edit` | Apply unified-style patches and return aggregate/per-file diff metadata. |
| `ls` | `Read` | List immediate directory entries. |
| `glob`, `find` | `Glob` | Search path names under a directory. |
| `grep` | `Grep` | Run bounded native text search and emit hashline match/context rows. |
| `bash` (`shell`) | `Bash` | Canonical Bash tool with hidden legacy `shell` dispatch; supports bounded pipe or real-PTY execution. |
| `webfetch` (`fetch`), `websearch` (`search`) | `WebFetch` / `WebSearch` | Fetch URLs or query a configured web-search provider. |
| `question`, `ask_user` | `Tool` | Ask the human a select or free-text question (interaction plane). |
| `lsp` | `Lsp` | Dispatch workspace-symbol/diagnostic-style LSP operations. |
| `skill` | `Skill` | Load and expose local `SKILL.md` content. |
| `list_agents` | `ReadOnly` | List spawnable agents for the model; allows without prompting under `default`. |
| `task` | `Task` | Start foreground/background subagent member work (spawner plane). |
| `workflow` | `Tool` | List, inspect, select, run, or inspect state for a governed Workflow through the shared control plane. |
| `todowrite` (`todo`) | `TodoWrite` | Store the latest session todo snapshot. |
| `plan_exit` (`plan`) | `Tool` | Signal plan-mode completion semantics to the model. |
| `roster`, `channels` | `ReadOnly` | Team roster and channel list; allow without prompting under `default`. |
| `send`, `announce`, `join`, `leave` | `Tool` | Unit-scoped mailbox send, one-way announce to direct reports, and channel join/leave; ask under `default`. |
| `invalid` | `Tool` | Structured response for unknown tool calls. |

Successful tool output passes through a global shape-aware cap
([`output_cap.rs`](../crates/hya-tool/src/output_cap.rs)) and is capped again
after post-tool hooks before Event publication. Unrelated tools keep the legacy
5000-character tail policy. Coding tools preserve bounded structured results,
including display metadata, diagnostics, and Edit diffs; nested rows/groups are
budgeted once. `bash` keeps up to 50 KiB inline and spills complete larger raw
output to a private cleanup-owned artifact. Search traversal and retained lines,
patterns, ignore rules, returned rows, counts, and warnings are bounded and
cancellation-aware.

## `hya-store`

`hya-store` persists the canonical event log in SQLite and related journals.

Important modules:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`src/lib.rs`](../crates/hya-store/src/lib.rs) | Connections, append/replay/`read_projection`, list/delete sessions, token ledger, `decode_session_key`. |
| [`src/admission.rs`](../crates/hya-store/src/admission.rs) | Durable spawn-admission journal (queue, bindings, fairness). |
| [`src/mailbox.rs`](../crates/hya-store/src/mailbox.rs) | Event-sourced mail writes, resident recovery, stop/failure finalization. |
| [`src/resident_claim.rs`](../crates/hya-store/src/resident_claim.rs) | Actor claim fencing primitives. |
| [`src/sync.rs`](../crates/hya-store/src/sync.rs) | Compat sync history/replay helpers. |
| [`src/permission.rs`](../crates/hya-store/src/permission.rs) | Saved permissions. |
| [`src/bundle_registry.rs`](../crates/hya-store/src/bundle_registry.rs) | **Separate** installed-bundle registry SQLite DB (not the session event log). |
| [`src/agent_model_preference.rs`](../crates/hya-store/src/agent_model_preference.rs) | Durable per-Agent model preference rows kept outside the session event log. |
| [`src/workflow.rs`](../crates/hya-store/src/workflow.rs) | Startup convergence for durable Workflow runs (admission and selection). |
| [`src/error.rs`](../crates/hya-store/src/error.rs) | Store error wrapper. |

Session-store migrations (`migrations/`):

| Migration | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `0001_init.sql` | Core schema: event log plus reserved tables (sessions, messages, parts, teams, mail, tasks, goals). Projection remains event-log based. |
| `0002_sync_event.sql` | Compat sync event history. |
| `0003_saved_permission.sql` | Saved permission rows. |
| `0004_admission_journal.sql` | Spawn admission journal. |
| `0005_resident_actor_claim.sql` | Resident actor claims. |
| `0006_admission_queue_states.sql` | Admission queue states. |
| `0007_admission_bindings.sql` | Admission bindings. |
| `0008_admission_fairness.sql` | Admission fairness bookkeeping. |
| `0009_agent_model_preference.sql` | Durable per-Agent model preference table. |

Bundle registry uses a **separate** migration set under
`bundle_migrations/0001_init.sql` for the installed-bundle database file.

`BundleRegistryRecord` columns (installed bundles): `bundle_id`, `version`,
`publisher`, 32-byte `source_digest`, `prepared_digest`, `prepared_bytes`,
`installed_at`, tracked under a monotonically increasing registry `generation`
that drives catalog reload (see [cli.md](cli.md) bundle section).

Current event-log path:

1. `append_event` inserts serialized `Event` JSON into `event_log`.
2. `replay` returns ordered `Envelope`s for one session.
3. `read_projection` folds replayed envelopes through `hya_proto::Projection`.

## `hya-core`

`hya-core` owns the runtime behavior.

Important modules:

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`engine.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/engine.rs) | `SessionEngine` composition and event emission. |
| [`engine/admission.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/engine/admission.rs) | User, command, and system-message admission. |
| [`engine/stream_round.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/engine/stream_round.rs), [`engine/turn.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/engine/turn.rs) | Provider rounds, tool execution, turn completion. |
| [`engine/shell.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/engine/shell.rs) | Direct shell turns. |
| [`engine/session_state.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/engine/session_state.rs) | Agent/model/session metadata updates. |
| [`engine/summary.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/engine/summary.rs), [`compaction.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/compaction.rs) | Summarization and provider-context compaction. |
| [`hooks.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/hooks.rs) | Runtime hook bridge used by plugins. |
| [`bus.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/bus.rs) | Broadcast event bus for live subscribers. |
| [`completion.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/completion.rs) | Generic iteration driver, goal mode, model-backed evaluator, transcript rendering. |
| [`loop_mode.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/loop_mode.rs) | Planner/verifier loop mode with budget, no-progress, and repeated-directive gates. |
| [`subagent.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/subagent.rs) | Supervised child-session member runs and bounded team evidence projection. |
| [`mailbox.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/mailbox.rs) | Mailbox service loop draining `MailboxRequest`. |
| [`engine/mailbox.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/engine/mailbox.rs) | Team-root mail delivery, announce, scope-filtered roster/channel queries, `MAIN_HANDLE`. |
| [`resident.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/resident.rs) | `ResidentSupervisor`, team state, per-team lock and quiescence. |
| [`orchestrator.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/orchestrator.rs) | `SubagentLimits`, `SubagentGovernor`, stream permits, per-team budgets. |
| [`runtime_registry.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/runtime_registry.rs) | `RuntimeRegistry`, `TurnBinding`, config-generation publication. |
| [`sidecar.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/sidecar.rs) | `SidecarLifecycle` contract for Bundle sidecars. |
| [`prompt.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/prompt.rs) | Prompt construction helpers. |
| [`title.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/title.rs) | Session title generation. |
| [`category.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/category.rs) | Category-to-model routing helpers and skill prompt injection. |
| [`workspace.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/workspace.rs) | Git worktree allocation/cleanup and tmux pane helper. |
| [`error.rs`](../crates/hya-core/src/error.rs) | Runtime error wrapper. |

(`team.rs` / `TeamControlPlane` were removed; see ADR-0001. Mailbox and resident
modules above are the live replacements.)

`SessionEngine` is the central durable write path: it appends events through the
store for committed work. Live-only envelopes use `publish_live` (seq `0`) and
**do not** go through the durable log. `publish_envelope` dispatches global and
activation/sidecar hooks **before** publishing on the `EventBus`, so the bus is
not the only consumer of an envelope.

The projection reducer applies `seq == 0` as live-only (does not advance
`last_seq`); durable envelopes with `seq <= last_seq` are ignored; otherwise the
event folds and `last_seq` advances.

## `hya-server`, `hya-api`, and `hya-client`

`hya-server` exposes the engine over exactly one contract — `hya.v1` — served
over HTTP/JSON+SSE+WebSocket under `/v1` and, with `HYA_GRPC_BIND`, over gRPC
through `V1Grpc`. Representative routes:

| Route | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /v1/sessions` | Create a session. |
| `POST /v1/sessions/{session}/turns` | Admit a prompt, slash-command, or shell turn (event-driven; returns a turn handle). |
| `GET /v1/sessions/{session}/workflow` | Return projected Workflow state through `WorkflowControl`. |
| `POST /v1/sessions/{session}/workflow` | Select, run, or query governed Workflow state through `WorkflowControl`. |
| `GET /v1/sessions/{session}/events` | Replay events after `sinceSeq` (`includeRaw` for raw envelopes). |
| `GET /v1/sessions/{session}/events/stream` | Stream live frames as SSE. |
| `GET /v1/events/stream` | Global live stream across a directory scope. |

The full 77-rpc inventory lives in
[`architecture/server-client.md`](architecture/server-client.md) and the
generated [API reference](protocol/api-reference.md); this page only records
the ownership boundary. The legacy Compat and native `/sessions/*` route
groups are deleted.

`hya-client` is the small typed wrapper over the v1 API (create session,
event-driven prompt admit+wait, curated and raw-envelope event replay,
pending-interaction list/respond). Rust frontends use `hya-sdk-v1` (typed SDK
with SSE `StreamFrame` subscription and `V1SessionMirror`). See
[`architecture/server-client.md`](architecture/server-client.md) for details.

## `hya-updater`

Independent self-update TCB (signed metadata, staged generations, smoke,
owner-gated activation). Not part of `hya-backend`. See
[self-update.md](self-update.md).

The OpenTUI frontend is under `packages/hya-tui`. It is a Bun client of the
same v1 HTTP/JSON+SSE contract as `hya-sdk-v1` and `hya-client`; Rust still owns
the runtime and persistence boundaries. The legacy TypeScript TUI was removed.

## Tests

Tests are crate-local and map closely to runtime boundaries. Product-path
process E2E is layered on top (Track P); see [Testing](testing/README.md).

| Path | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| [`../crates/hya-core/tests`](../crates/hya-core/tests) | Turn loop, goal/loop gates, teams, subagents, categories, worktrees. |
| [`../crates/hya-app/tests`](../crates/hya-app/tests) | Nested spawn tree, admission, installed-bundle refresh, runtime composition. |
| [`../crates/hya-provider/tests`](../crates/hya-provider/tests) | OpenAI/Anthropic conformance, provider preflight, canonical event shape. |
| [`../crates/hya-store/tests`](../crates/hya-store/tests) | Migration, projection, session scoping, persistence, token ledger. |
| [`../crates/hya-tool/tests`](../crates/hya-tool/tests) | Permission evaluation and builtin tools. |
| [`../crates/hya-server/tests`](../crates/hya-server/tests) | v1 HTTP contract behavior and HTTP/gRPC parity. |
| [`../crates/hya-plugin/tests`](../crates/hya-plugin/tests) | Plugin host protocol, hooks, and tool bridge behavior. |
| [`../crates/hya-plugin-bun/adapter/test`](../crates/hya-plugin-bun/adapter/test) | Bun adapter wire protocol, tools, hooks, activation lifecycle. |
| [`../crates/hya-backend/tests`](../crates/hya-backend/tests) | Bundle CLI, backend command integration. |
| [`../crates/hya-e2e`](../crates/hya-e2e) | Track P process agent suite (FakeLlm + real backend). Matrix: [`../crates/hya-e2e/matrix.toml`](../crates/hya-e2e/matrix.toml). |
| [`testing/`](testing/) | Human docs for tracks, oracles, and optional CI snippet. |

## Dependency Direction

The intended dependency direction is:

```text
hya-proto
  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^
  |  |  |  |  |
provider tool store server/sdk
        ^      ^
        |      |
       mcp  hya-core
              ^
              |
            hya-app

hya-backend -> hya-app/hya-server
```

The binary crate composes everything. Lower crates should avoid depending on the
binary or on UI-specific behavior.
