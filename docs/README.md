# hya Documentation

hya is an event-sourced coding agent. Rust owns the runtime, server, and
persistence boundaries. The OpenTUI frontend under `packages/hya-tui` drives
the backend through the `hya.v1` HTTP/JSON+SSE contract. Other clients use
`hya-sdk-v1`, `hya-client`, HTTP/WebSocket, or gRPC. Workflow compilation, durable
execution, package models, and the consolidated `hya.v1` HTTP/gRPC contract
are documented separately below.

This documentation is split into user-facing guides and maintainer-facing
architecture notes.

## The v1 API contract

- [Protocol guide](protocol/README.md) — how any client (GUI, WebUI, CLI, or
  OpenTUI) integrates over HTTP/SSE/WebSocket or gRPC (identical semantics
  on both).
- [API reference](protocol/api-reference.md) — generated per-rpc reference.
- [OpenAPI](protocol/openapi.json) — generated HTTP schema.

## Reading Paths

If you want to run hya:

1. [Getting Started](getting-started.md)
2. [Configuration](configuration.md)
3. [Compaction](compaction.md) — the five context-reduction mechanisms and their configurable order
4. [CLI Reference](cli.md)
5. [OpenTUI frontend](tui.md)
6. [Skills](skills.md) — discovery, skill tool, and authoring
7. [Workflows](workflows.md) — user-authored stage DAGs over subagent teams
8. [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)

If you want to compare hya with adjacent coding agents:

1. [hya, Pi, and Compat Feature Comparison](hya-pi-compat-comparison.md)

If you want to package a public AgentBundle or WorkflowBundle:

1. Run `hya-backend bundle info -f example.hyabundle`, then
   `hya-backend bundle install example.hyabundle`.
2. Read [AgentBundle Authoring](agent-bundle-authoring.md) for singular Agent
   payloads, or [Workflows](workflows.md#packaging-a-workflowbundle) for one
   Workflow plus its exact reachable Agent closure. Sources use exactly one
   root form: `bundle.yaml` for both kinds, or `bundle.hya.md` only for an
   AgentBundle body prompt. Start from the
   [single-file static example](examples/bundle.hya.md), the
   [transient Bun example](examples/bun-transient/), the
   [resident Bun example](examples/bun-resident/), the
   [disjoint Bun example](examples/bun-disjoint/), or the
   [directory `bundle.yaml` layout](../crates/hya-bundle/tests/fixtures/directory/bundle.yaml),
   and use the [bundle CLI reference](cli.md#bundle-commands). Built-in Agents
   are compiled in and cannot be shadowed by either package kind.

If you want the independent self-update path (0.34.13+):

1. Read [Secure self-update](self-update.md).
2. Run the local dry-run under [examples/self-update](examples/self-update/).
3. Remember: signatures alone never activate; production needs explicit owner
   authorization, and `install.sh` remains break-glass recovery.

If you want to understand the codebase:

1. [Project Structure](project-structure.md)
2. [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md)
3. [Runtime](architecture/runtime.md)
4. [Admission and Governor](architecture/admission-and-governor.md)
5. [Event Model](architecture/event-model.md)
6. [Providers](architecture/providers.md)
7. [Tools and Permissions](architecture/tools-and-permissions.md)
8. [Agent tool surface](architecture/agent-tool-surface.md)
9. [Subagent Orchestration](architecture/subagent-orchestration.md)
10. [Storage](architecture/storage.md)
11. [Server and Client](architecture/server-client.md)
12. [Plugin protocol](plugin-protocol.md)
13. [Development](development.md)
14. [Testing](testing/README.md) (process E2E, agent matrix, CI snippet)
